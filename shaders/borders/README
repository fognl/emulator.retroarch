These shaders are designed to overlay a specially designed border image
over the integer-scaled content window. Such an image should be sized to
fit the output resolution (such as 1920x1080 px) and should have an
appropriately sized transparent window in the middle for the content to
show through.

The border.png image file found in this directory can be used as a template.
